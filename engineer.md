# Competencies
There are a core set of abilities that, regardless of industry, software engineers need to cultivate. I have organized those into three distinct buckets, purely technical skills, skills required to function well as part of a software development organization, and interpersonal skills.

## Technical
Purely technical skills are those most often associated with engineering, the basis for an engineer's ability to do their job well.
### Clean Code
Convert high level descriptions of a problem, e.g. user stories, into performant and readable code that meets the user's expectations. Understand when trade-offs between readability and performance exist, and be able to make good decisions on which is preferable in the given context.
### Debugging
Discovering and correcting the root cause of defects in system behavior. Using an understanding of computer science fundamentals, e.g. monitoring, operating systems, networking, distributed systems, programming languages, etc. to investigate existing code bases and running systems to determine a minimally invasive corrective action that aligns with the current coding practices and system design.
### Quality Assurance
Building solutions that meet customer expectations. Using qualitative and quantitative measures for user experience including defect tracking, incident reporting, automated and manual testing, user surveys, customer service feedback, and application performance monitoring to determine the user's experience and remediate defects.
### Architecture
Designing effective software solutions to complex business problems. Work at various levels of abstraction to leverage existing standards and infrastructure components to create maintainable, elegant, and creative designs.
### Infrastructure
Improving system performance, reliability, security, or delivery velocity through the adoption of new technologies. Identifying bottlenecks in critical data flows, diagnosing root causes, investigating potential solutions, and implementing new workflows with minimal interruption to existing systems.

## Process
Engineers will work within a team, with other teams in an organization, and as part of a larger business unit or company. The ability to align individual work with larger goals is a required part of modern software development.
### Collaborative Design
Able to build coordinate with other teams and the organization's technical oversight to ensure new development is in-line with company standards, is not duplicated effort, and accounts for potential re-use by others.
### Delivery Management
Understands the complications involved in delivering software to the end user and coordinates with engineers, product managers, and stakeholders to identify external dependencies, mitigate technical risk, and remove bottlenecks.
### Software Development Lifecycle
Works effectively in an environment that is focused on frequent, iterative delivery and practices just-in-time planning and design. Understands and the principles of agile software development.
### Product Development
Partners with product managers and user experience designers to implement the build-measure-learn cycle. Is an active participant in product discovery, solution design, and user acceptance testing.

## Soft skills
### Attention To Detail
Effectively focuses on completing tasks to a high level of quality. Understands the context of their work, identifies, communicates, and addresses any issue they encounter as a part of completing their task.
### Communication
Is proactive, friendly, transparent, and collaborative with stakeholders and teammates. Accounts for their audience and delivers appropriate levels of detail. 
### Continued Education
Actively working to pick up new skills, technologies, and business domains. Knows how to ask questions, identify knowledge gaps, and acknowledge the expertise of subject-matter experts.
### Teamwork
Understands the value of collaboration, that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Prioritizes reaching the team's goals over individual success and actively participates in the continuous improvement of the team. Trusts others are working towards shared goals and is accountable to reaching them.
### Mentoring
Values the growth of others and sharing their experiences. Effectively helps others gain skills, knowledge, and experience.

# Levels
Following Marty Cagen's [example](https://www.svpg.com/coaching-tools-the-assessment/) gap analysis the numbers given below are example "importance" scores. They are supplied as an example and should be changed to fit the needs of your organization.
