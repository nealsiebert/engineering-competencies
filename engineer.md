# Competencies

## Technical
### Clean Code
Convert a high level description of a problem into performant and readable code. Understanding when tradeoffs between readability and performance exist, and be able to make good decisions on which is preferable in the given context and will meet the user's expectations.
### Debugging
Discovering and correcting the root cause of defects in system behavior. Using an understand of monitoring, operating systems, networking, distributed systems, programming languages, etc. to investigate existing code bases as well as running systems to determine a minimally invasive corrective action that aligns with the current coding practices and system design.
### Quality Assurance
Building solutions that meet your customers expectations. Using qualitative and quantitative measures for user experience including defect tracking, incident reporting, automated and manual testing, user surveys, customer service feedback, and application performance monitoring to determine the user's experience and remediate defects.
### Architecture
Designing effective software solutions to complex business problems. Work at various levels of abstraction to leverage existing standards and infrastructure components to create maintainable, elegant, and creative designs.
### Infrastructure
Improving systems performance, reliability, security, or delivery velocity through the adoption of new technologies. Identifying bottlenecks in critical data flows, diagnosing root causes, investigating potential solutions, and implementing new workflows with minimal interruption to existing systems.

## Process
### Collaborative Design
Able to build coordinate with other teams / technical oversight to ensure new development meetings needs and does not re-invent the wheel
### Delivery Management
Develops project plans that mitigate risk, have clear milestones, and identifies external dependencies.
### Agile Development
A general understanding of agile methodologies and why JIT planning, sort iterations are valuable.
### Product Development
An overview of how product is delivered in successful companies. Understanding the importance of discovery and design in the process, and how engineers should be involved.

## Soft skills
### Attention To Detail
Part of being an effective software engineer is not letting the little things slide, if you see a problem no matter how small find a way to address it.
### Communication
Engineering is the practice of bringing new solutions to existing problems. Without effective communication with team members, stakeholders, and customers it is impossible to determine if your proposed solution will actually solve the problem.
### Continued Education
Engineers should be actively working to quickly pick up new skills, technologies, and business domains. Knowing how to ask questions, identify holes in your understanding, and acknowledge that the engineer is rarely the domain expert.
### Teamwork
The scope of todays software is too large and requires too many different skills to be accomplished by an individual. It is mission critical to a software engineer to be able to work effectively as a part of a team.
### Mentoring
